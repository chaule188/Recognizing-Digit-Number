# Recognizing-Digit-Number
Using several simple machine learning algorithms to recognize digit number (MNIST dataset). \n
Models are evaluated by using 5-fold cross validation. It means that 80% of the sample will be used for training and 20% for testing.

# Dependencies
pandas: to precess data \n
matplotlib, seaborn: for data visualization \n
DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, KneighborsClassifier, SVM: machine learning classifiers \n
cross_val_score, accuracy_score: to evaluate models \n
train_test_split: separating data into training and test data \n
